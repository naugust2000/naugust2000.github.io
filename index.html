										<p style="font-size:10px">This article informs the public that the negative feelings associated with social media usage are not unusual. This issue, however, is rarely spoken of publicly. The article proceeds to give possible explanations for these negative emotions. By being aware of one's triggers, negative emotions are less likely to arise. Social media has the potential to increase interaction and provide positive emotions. This is only applicable, however, once people stop using these platforms to compare themselves to one another.
